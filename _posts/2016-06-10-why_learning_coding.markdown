Ladies, Gents,

I don't think I can reinvent the wheel for this post given the numerous blog posts, articles, videos already explaining why you should learn to code but I will share my own approach and the profound reasons that motivated me to learn how to code.

I didn't start to learn how to code because I had to or because it is currently the new trend or because yesterday the weather was sunny in London. No! I started to learn coding because I simply found out I was passionate about it. As I was looking for something new to learn I watched some introductory lessons to coding and it seemed quite okay but not really exciting at first. But then, I discovered CS50 Harvard class and all of the sudden, it all clicked for me. I loved it immediately and I started to understand the limitless things you can do and the great power it could provide to achieve superior things. And all of this, simply requires a brain (better if it is yours actually), some (but potentially a lot of) creativity, and a keyboard (better if connected to a computer by the way).

Despite being passionate about it, I seriously think it is a fantastic way to achieve amazing things in a very productive and efficient manner that couldn't be done otherwise. Imagine what would be our lives today without the technology, without the computer, without the smartphone, you name it. It allows to bring ideas and concepts to life. But it is so much more than that. Coding is a tool used by an entire industry which impact other not to say all other industries and economies and potentially every human being and every entity (whether it is a group of people, an association, an organization, a company, a state, a government, etc.).

When you know how to code you can create things that make your life better but then you immediately think about a greater goal, so you create things that make your friends and relatives' lives better but why not going one step further, why not creating something that will reach everyone on earth. Something so big that it will change our way of living, of thinking, of sharing, of consuming, of approaching life and time and space. If coding is a tool that allows you to create intangible things originally, the impacts are tangible. If we consider resources are of a given quantity, and if coding provides a way to achieve at least the same amount of work or operations than before but with less consumptions of resources, then these same unused resources could be allocated to something else. I believe we can applied this to various industries in many ways and that it could contribute to improve our lives.

Sincerely,
